###Equivalence partitioning
A software technique that divides the input data of a software unit input into partitions of
equivalent data from which test cases can be derived.\
It can be seen as a sort of black box testing technique.

- It divides input data of software into different equivalence data classes.
- You can apply this technique, where there is a range in the input field.

Let's say for instance, that there are 3 groups of people,
Teens(>12 && < 20).
Young adults(>20 && < 45)
